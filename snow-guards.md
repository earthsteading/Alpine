# Inspection checklist for alpine snow guard rails

This checklist is written to enable the checking of alpine snow guards in the Australian alpine environment.

## Standards, legislation and term definitions

  - [ ] NCC 2019 Volume Two Amendment 1 Part 3.10.4 Construction in Alpine Areas > Performance P2.7.4 Buildings in alpine areas
  - [ ] AS1170 Part 3 structural design actions: snow and ice actions (2003, Reconfirmed 2016)
  - [ ] ASxxxx = Weatherproofing finishing of guards: mill finish or powder coating
  - [ ] other

## Risk mitigation
Significant risks to mitigate in snow guard design:
 1. Structural load --> roof collapse
 2. Penetrations in roof to attach snow guards --> roof leaking
 3. Ice blocking the gutters --> gutters being damaged, falling off
 4. Icicles forming along the roof eaves --> falling on people/property below
 5. Significant snow storm building up snow higher than the snow guards/rails can hault --> roof snow avalanche

  - [ ] Has an engineer approved the roof load weights which will be experienced in the alpine environment, especially snow weight and wind force?
  - [ ] Is the lateral force of the snow on the snow guard able to withstand the weight of snow from a 1 in 100 year snow storm?
  - [ ] Are the penetration made in the roof to secure the snow guards going to compromise the weatherproofing of the roof, especially leaks?
  - [ ] Are the eaves and gutters able to withstand the amount of snow, ice and water which will be contained by the snow guards atop the roof?
  - [ ] Will people/property be endangered by icicles forming and falling from the roof eaves onto the ground below?
